# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

## 题目

Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.

You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

Example 1:
Input:
```
	Tree 1                     Tree 2                  
          1                         2                             
         / \                       / \                            
        3   2                     1   3                        
       /                           \   \                      
      5                             4   7                  
```
Output: 
```
Merged tree:
	     3
	    / \
	   4   5
	  / \   \ 
	 5   4   7
Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
```

## 思路

同步访问两棵树中相同位置即可。要求从root节点开始merge，因为采用先序遍历（根左右）。

考察自带的接口能不能用于递归：给定两棵树相同位置的节点，返回新树对应位置的节点。

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* mergeTrees(TreeNode* t1, TreeNode* t2) {
        if (t1 == nullptr && t2 == nullptr) return nullptr;
        int sum = 0;
        if (t1) sum += t1->val;
        if (t2) sum += t2->val;
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(sum);
        node->left = mergeTrees(t1 ? t1->left : t1, t2 ? t2->left : t2);
        node->right = mergeTrees(t1 ? t1->right : t1, t2 ? t2->right : t2);
        return node;
    }
};
```
