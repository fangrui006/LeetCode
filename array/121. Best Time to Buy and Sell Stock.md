#121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
###题目
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example1:
```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
```

Example2:
```
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

```
###思路
动态规划：以第i日作为sell日，已知前i-1天的最小buy日，可以得出以第i天为sell日的最大profit，并更新全局最大profit。
```
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
        int minBuy = prices[0];
        int maxPro = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i - 1] < minBuy)
                minBuy = prices[i - 1];
            if (prices[i] > minBuy && prices[i] - minBuy > maxPro)
                maxPro = prices[i] - minBuy;
        }
        return maxPro;
    }
};
```
