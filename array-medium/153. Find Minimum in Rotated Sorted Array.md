#153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
###题目

假设一个已排序的数组在某个位置做了旋转，找出数组中的最小元素。比如排序数组[0 1 2 4 5 6 7]旋转后变成[4 5 6 7 0 1 2]。

 - assume数组中没有重复元素
 
###思路

二分查找：

1. loop is left < right, which means inside the loop, left always < right
2. since we use round up for mid, and left < right from (1), right would never be the same as mid
3. Therefore, we compare mid with right, since they will never be the same from (2)
4. if nums[mid] < nums[right], we will know the minimum should be in the left part, so we are moving right.
We can always make right = mid while we don't have to worry the loop will not ends. Since from (2), we know right would never be the same as mid, making right = mid will assure the interval is shrinking.
5. if nums[mid] > nums[right], minimum should be in the right part, so we are moving left. Since nums[mid] > nums[right],mid can't be the minimum, we can safely move left to mid + 1, which also assure the interval is shrinking
```
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l = 0, r = (int)nums.size() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            //这种求m的方式避免加法溢出
            int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
            if (nums[m] > nums[r])
                l = m + 1;
            else
                r = m;
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
};
```

易错点：


1. mid的求法：如果`m = (l +　r) / 2`，可能存在加法溢出的情况；
2. 写二分查找的关键：保证每次迭代[l, r]的长度都在收缩！
